"""NETCONF tools for v1.4.0 agentic mode.

Six tools exposed to the LLM:
  Read-only:
    - list_devices            list configured devices from inventory
    - get_running_config      pull device running-config via NETCONF
    - get_state               pull operational state (interfaces / routes / etc.)
    - validate_config_xml     validate a NETCONF payload via candidate datastore

  Write (REQUIRE APPROVAL):
    - propose_edit_config     compose an edit-config payload, return a diff
    - apply_edit_config       execute a previously approved payload

Write tools never apply changes by themselves. They return a special
APPROVAL_PENDING marker which the agent loop intercepts to pause and request
human approval via the diff modal. Only after an explicit approve event are
the changes committed.

ncclient is imported lazily so the package boots fine on machines that
don't have it installed yet (e.g., during initial setup before pip install).
