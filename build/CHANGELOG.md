# CHANGELOG

## hitech_automation_ai.1.27.0 — 2026-06-24

### Changed — full product rename (netconf-sender → hiTech Automation AI)
- **App identity:** `APP_VERSION` is now `hitech_automation_ai.1.27.0`; page title/H1 → "hiTech
  Automation AI"; FastAPI app title, logger name, and docstrings updated. Release zips are now
  named `hitech_automation_ai.<ver>.zip`.
- **State directory renamed** `~/.netconf-sender/` → `~/.hitech_automation_ai/` (inventory,
  secrets, saved collections, audit log, vector_db). A single shared `tools/state_dir.py` now
  owns this path. **One-time auto-migration:** on first start, if the new dir is missing but the
  legacy `~/.netconf-sender/` exists, its contents are copied over automatically (the legacy dir
  is left intact) — existing installs keep their inventory and saved collections with no manual step.
- **systemd service renamed** `netconf-sender` → `hitech_automation_ai` (unit + drop-ins). Daily
  commands are now `systemctl --user restart hitech_automation_ai`.
- **Browser localStorage keys** `netconfsw.*` → `hitech.*` (panel sizes/preferences reset once;
  saved collections are server-side and unaffected).

### Migration (host, one-time)
- Rename the systemd unit + secrets drop-in and move state dir (see INSTALL.md). The app-side
  auto-migration is a safety net if the state dir wasn't moved by hand.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.26.5 — 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **Interactive CLI: `NameError: name 'uuid' is not defined` on Open.** The session handler used
  `uuid.uuid4()` but `uuid` was never imported at module top (same class as the earlier `re` miss).
  Added `import uuid`. Open sessions now work.

### Changed
- **Renamed the CLI "Interactive" sub-mode to "Netmiko Interactive"** (radio label + pane heading)
  to reflect that it uses a persistent Netmiko channel (write_channel/read_channel/find_prompt).
- Read loop now uses Netmiko's `check_data_available()` when present (less blocking, cleaner reads).


## hitech_automation_ai.1.26.4 — 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **Interactive CLI: "connected" then immediately "no active session" on Send.** The error
  wrapper returns HTTP 200 with `{ok:false, error:...}`, but the open/send UI only checked the
  HTTP status — so a backend error was treated as success, the session id came back undefined,
  and the next Send reported no active session (hiding the real error). The UI now treats
  `ok:false` / missing `session_id` as failure and prints the actual server error in the terminal.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.26.3 — 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **Interactive CLI: Send appeared unresponsive + blank terminal.** If the device returned no
  prompt banner (or `find_prompt()` failed) the terminal looked empty and Send could no-op.
  Now: (1) the backend open path falls back gracefully if `find_prompt()` fails, so a session is
  always established; (2) the terminal shows a clear "connected — type a command" line when the
  banner is empty; (3) Send never fails silently — it reports "no active session" if there isn't
  one, and surfaces any error in the terminal pane.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.26.2 — 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **Interactive CLI "JSON.parse: unexpected character" error.** The open/send endpoints could
  raise an unhandled exception that returned a plain-text 500, which the UI tried to parse as
  JSON and failed with an opaque message. Two fixes: (1) both endpoints now wrap their body and
  always return JSON `{ok:false, error:...}` with a real message; (2) the error wrapper itself
  referenced an undefined `logger` (the module's logger is named `log`) — corrected. The UI now
  reads responses defensively and shows the actual server message in the terminal pane.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.26.1 — 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **Startup crash in 1.26.0** — `NameError: name 're' is not defined`. The new interactive-CLI
  code used `re.compile(...)` at module load, but `re` was only imported inside two helper
  functions, never at module top. Added a top-level `import re`. Service starts normally again.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.26.0 — 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Interactive CLI sessions** (new "Interactive" sub-mode on the CLI transport). Opens a
  persistent Netmiko SSH channel held open server-side, so you can answer device confirmation
  prompts live — `reload` → `(y/n)?`, `no username X` → `[confirm]`, `copy run start`,
  `delete flash:`, etc. The terminal pane shows whatever the device prints; when it stops at a
  prompt instead of returning to `hostname#`, a reply box lets you type your answer (e.g. `y`)
  and continue. Works for both IOS-XE and NX-OS prompt styles.
  - Backend: server-side session registry with open/send/close endpoints
    (`/api/cli-interactive/*`), a read-until-quiet loop with pager auto-advance, prompt-vs-await
    detection, EOF/closure detection (a confirmed `reload` drops the session — reported cleanly),
    and a 5-minute idle reaper.
  - **Safety:** interactive mode is **blocked on read-only devices** (set `read_only: false` to
    use it), since it can run `reload`/`erase`/config. `terminal length 0` is set on open to
    avoid pager stalls.

### Notes
- Interactive sessions are live channels and can't be saved as collection nodes.
- Single-user/localhost design: sessions live in server memory.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.25.0 — 2026-06-23

### Added
- **VS Code-style formatted, foldable JSON/XML response view** on every result pane
  (https-restconf, curl, python, XPath, NETCONF, CLI). Built once in the shared renderer:
  - **Collapsible folding** — a caret on every JSON object/array and every XML element with
    children; folded nodes show a hint (e.g. `… 3 keys`). **⊟ collapse-all / ⊞ expand-all**
    buttons in the pane toolbar.
  - **Line-number gutter + indent guides** for an editor-like view; reuses the existing
    2-space pretty-print and JSON/XML token colors.
  - **Bracket/tag-pair hover** — hovering a JSON `{`/`[` or an XML open/close tag highlights its
    matching partner (and the gutter), so you can see the block span.
  - **🔎 Find** is tree-aware: a match inside a folded node auto-expands its ancestors to reveal it.
  - **Lazy fold for big payloads** — responses over ~400 lines auto-collapse below depth 2 to stay snappy.
  - Falls back to flat colorized text if the body can't be parsed; plain-text panes are unaffected.
  - Copy (📋) still copies the raw response text.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.24.0 — 2026-06-23

### Changed
- **Graphical Save dialog** replaces the old type-a-number prompt for "Save current →" on every
  transport (RESTCONF/NETCONF/CLI/XPath/Python). One modal: click the destination folder to
  select it (highlights), type the request name, hit Save (Enter works; Esc / click-outside /
  Cancel dismiss). Existing folders only — create new folders with the sidebar's + Folder.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.23.1 — 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **Startup 500 / Internal Server Error introduced in 1.23.0.** Three JavaScript comments in the
  new pretty-print function contained literal `{{ }}` text, which the Jinja2 template engine tried
  to evaluate while rendering index.html, raising TemplateSyntaxError. Reworded the comments
  (no functional change). Page renders normally again.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.23.0 — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Saved requests now persist their post-response filters.**
  - **RESTCONF (https):** the jq filter bar (expression, `-r`, engine) is saved with the node and
    restored when you open it — pre-filled so it applies on your next Apply.
  - **XPath:** both client-side filters are saved — the **XPath filter** (expression + namespace-aware
    flag) and the **Extract fields → table** (row element + columns). On opening a saved XPath node,
    the query auto-runs and the saved filter auto-applies (watched via a result observer, with a
    safety timeout) so you get the customized output in one click.

### Notes
- curl and python nodes need no extra filter capture — their filtering lives in the saved command/code.
- Existing saved nodes without a `filters` blob load fine (filters simply start empty).


## hitech_automation_ai.1.22.0 — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Pretty-print button on the RESTCONF Payload** — reformats the JSON body with 2-space
  indentation in place. Template vars like `{{APIC_HOST}}` are masked before parsing and
  restored after, so var-bearing bodies format fine; invalid JSON shows an inline error.
- **🔎 Find in response** on every result pane (RESTCONF/curl/python/XPath/NETCONF/CLI) via the
  shared pane toolbar. Highlights matches over the raw text, match count + next/prev (Enter /
  Shift-Enter), case-sensitive toggle, and a regex toggle that covers wildcard search (Bruno-style).

### Fixed
- **Duplicate** now clears the request's saved-node link, so saving a duplicated request no
  longer overwrites the original's node.
- **Save →** on an https request opened from a saved node no longer overwrites silently — it
  asks **Update** vs **Save as new** (Postman pattern). Right-click → New folder/Save current
  stays the always-new path.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.21.0 — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Per-transport collection trees.** Every transport now has its own Bruno-style collection
  tree in the sidebar — NETCONF, RESTCONF, CLI, XPath, and Python — and the one for the active
  nav transport is shown. Each is stored in its own file under `~/.hitech_automation_ai/`
  (`<scope>_tree.json`). All share the same engine: unlimited folders, right-click
  (new folder / save current / rename / delete), drag-and-drop, per-section ▾ collapse.
  - **NETCONF:** saves Jinja2 (vars+template+op) or XML payload nodes; clicking **loads only**
    (device writes never auto-run) — review then Validate/Send.
  - **CLI:** saves Jinja2 or Raw command nodes; **load only**.
  - **XPath:** saves device+source+expression; clicking **auto-runs** the query (read-only).
    Existing "Saved queries" are migrated into the XPath tree on first load.
  - **Python:** saves the full multi-file project (files + entry + env); clicking loads the
    project (press Run).
  - **RESTCONF:** unchanged (https/curl/python kinds, curl/python auto-run).

### Changed
- Tree engine generalized to a scope-aware controller; `/api/rc-tree*` endpoints take a `scope`.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.20.1 — 2026-06-22

### Changed
- **Merged the RESTCONF collections tree into the single left sidebar.** The separate docked
  panel is gone; the tree now lives directly under the nav items (under RESTCONF), in one column.
  A single drag bar on the sidebar's right edge resizes the whole sidebar (180–520px); width
  persists; double-click resets to 240px. The ▾/▸ toggle hides/shows the tree in place.
  Collapsing the nav (≡) shrinks the whole bar and restores your width on expand.
- All v1.20.0 behavior (kind-aware save/load/auto-run for https/curl/python, badges, right-click,
  drag-drop, colorful JSON) is unchanged.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.20.0 — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Docked, resizable RESTCONF collection panel (Bruno-style)** — the collection tree moved
  out of the content area into a dedicated panel right of the icon nav, **always visible**
  across all sections. A vertical drag bar resizes it (160px up to 50% of the window); width
  persists; double-click the bar resets to default. Collapse with ⟨, reveal with the 📁 button.
- **Save / load / auto-run curl & python in the tree** — request nodes are now kind-aware
  (`https` / `curl` / `python`). On curl-restconf or python-restconf, "Save current" stores the
  command / code (+ python env box) under any folder with a name (e.g. `curl-xe-native-get`).
  Clicking a curl or python node switches to that submode, loads the content, and **auto-runs**
  it; https nodes load into the builder as before. Node badges show kind (`curl`, `py`, or the
  HTTP method).
- **Colorful JSON in curl & python output panes** too (parity with the https response).

### Notes
- Existing saved nodes default to kind `https` — fully backward compatible.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.19.0 — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Bruno-style collection tree for RESTCONF** — replaces the flat Project/Saved dropdowns
  with an unlimited-depth folder tree. Click a request to load it; right-click any node for
  New folder / New request here / Save current here / Rename / Delete; drag-and-drop to move
  requests and folders between folders (drop on empty space = move to root). Stored at
  `~/.hitech_automation_ai/restconf_tree.json` (survives upgrades). Existing Postman collections are
  migrated into the tree on first run; Postman/Bruno collection import adds a new top-level folder.
- **Colorful JSON responses** — https-restconf JSON responses are now syntax-highlighted
  (keys / strings / numbers / booleans / null), matching the existing XML coloring. String
  contents (e.g. dotted IPs) are protected so they are never mis-tokenized as numbers.

### Changed
- New backend: `tools/restconf_tree.py` + `/api/rc-tree[...]` endpoints (get / add-folder /
  add-request / update-request / rename / delete / move / import-collection).


## hitech_automation_ai.1.18.0 — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **curl-restconf response headers** — each `curl` invocation in the pasted snippet is
  auto-instrumented (`-D <tmpfile>`) so its response headers are captured without altering
  the command. A collapsible "Response headers" block mirrors the https-restconf one;
  multiple curls show sequential `── curl #N ──` blocks in order.
- **jq filter on https-restconf response** — a filter bar appears under the Response when the
  body is JSON. Two selectable engines: **Browser (wasm)** runs vendored jq in-page (instant,
  offline; `static/jq/jq.js` + `jq.wasm`); **Server (system jq)** posts to `/api/jq` and runs
  the VM's real `jq` (matches your terminal exactly). `-r` toggle, Enter to apply, Raw to reset.

### Notes
- `/api/jq` passes the filter as a single argv (no shell) — no injection; 8 MB input cap, 15 s
  timeout; if `jq` is absent it nudges you to the Browser engine.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.14.0 — 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Saved XPath queries.** A "📁 Saved queries" panel on the XPath pane lets you organize device queries into projects (folders) and save them by name (Save / Save As), with Delete and project create/delete. Selecting a saved query fills the query box, Device, and Source — the device is pre-filled but you can switch to another before running. Stored as plain JSON at `~/.hitech_automation_ai/xpath/<project>.json` (outside `build/`, survives upgrades); Export/Import for backup/share (no Postman wrapper — XPath isn't an HTTP request). Endpoints: `/api/xq-projects`, `/api/xq-project-create`, `/api/xq-project-delete`, `/api/xq-queries`, `/api/xq-save`, `/api/xq-delete`, `/api/xq-export`, `/api/xq-import`.

### Changed
- **Device XPath query box is now multiline** — converted from a single-line input to a textarea so long expressions can span lines (Enter = newline; run via the button). The text is sent verbatim; XPath ignores whitespace between steps/predicates, so multiline just works.

## hitech_automation_ai.1.13.0 — 2026-06-01

### Added
- **XPath filter on the Result(XML)** — a new "🔎 XPath filter (real XPath 1.0)" tool sits alongside "Extract fields → table" under the XPath Result pane; both run against the same query output, so you pick table-extraction or a raw XPath filter. Unlike the table tool's local-name chain, this is **real XPath 1.0** via server-side lxml: predicates `[...]`, `//`, `@attr`, functions (`contains()`, `text()`, `local-name()`, `count()`, ...), `and`/`or`, positions. Element matches render as pretty XML, value/attribute/number/boolean results as text, with a match count and Copy. New endpoint `POST /api/xpath-test {xml, expr, ignore_ns}`.
- Namespaces are **ignored by default** (stripped server-side) so unprefixed expressions just work on RESTCONF/NETCONF XML; a "namespace-aware" checkbox switches to using the document's declared namespaces (default ns as `ns`).
- The filter input is a multiline textarea (Enter = newline; run via the button), passed to the engine verbatim — XPath is whitespace-insensitive between steps/predicates, so long expressions can span lines.

## hitech_automation_ai.1.12.3 — 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **RESTCONF auth fields now resolve `{{ }}` variables / environment vars.** Previously the server rendered Jinja only in the URL, header values, and body — the Basic-auth username/password and the bearer token were taken literally, so `{{username}}` / `{{password}}` (e.g. from an active environment) were sent verbatim and the device returned 401. `_render()` is now applied to `auth_username`, `auth_password`, and `auth_token` as well. As a side effect, "Export request → code" now shows the resolved credentials instead of literal `{{vars}}`.

## hitech_automation_ai.1.12.2 — 2026-06-01

### Changed
- Renamed the product display name from "hiTech Automation AI" to **hiTech_Network_Automation_Tool_AI** — browser tab title, the main header (`<h1>`), and the FastAPI app title (shown at `/docs`). Display-only: the NETCONF *protocol* labels, the `netconf-sender` systemd service id, and the `hitech_automation_ai.` version/zip-naming scheme are unchanged.

## hitech_automation_ai.1.12.1 — 2026-06-01

Hotfix for v1.12.0.

### Fixed
- **500 Internal Server Error on every page load.** `index.html` is rendered through Jinja2, and the v1.12.0 environment-vars hint contained a literal `{{ ... }}` sequence in its JavaScript, which Jinja tried to evaluate as a template expression (`TemplateSyntaxError: unexpected char '$'`) — killing the render before any HTML was sent. Wrapped the literal-brace spots in `{% raw %}…{% endraw %}` so Jinja emits them verbatim.
- Same fix applied to the new environment-editor help text and placeholder (`{{key}}`, `{{host}}`), which were rendering blank.
- Also fixed two pre-existing placeholders that had silently rendered blank for the same reason: the RESTCONF URL box (`{{device_host}}`) and the CLI Jinja-template box (`{{ name }} {{ ip }} {{ mask }}`).

## hitech_automation_ai.1.12.0 — 2026-06-01

RESTCONF persistent storage — collections + environments, Postman/Bruno compatible.

### Added
- **Collections (projects).** Save https-restconf requests into named projects that persist on disk. Each project is one **Postman Collection v2.1 JSON** file at `~/.hitech_automation_ai/restconf/<project>.postman_collection.json` (outside `build/`, so it survives zip upgrades). UI: a "📁 Collections & environments" panel on the RESTCONF https tab with Project + Saved-request dropdowns and New / Save / Save As / Delete. Opening a saved request loads it into the active request tab.
- **Environments.** Named variable bags (e.g. per host) stored as **Postman Environment JSON** at `~/.hitech_automation_ai/restconf-environments/<env>.postman_environment.json`. Pick an active environment from a dropdown and edit its vars (`key = value` lines). At send time the active env's vars merge into the request's variables (request-level vars win), so `{{host}}`, `{{base}}`, `{{token}}` resolve via the existing Jinja rendering.
- **Export / Import.** Export a project or environment to its JSON file (download) — already in Postman format, so it imports directly into **Postman or Bruno** (Bruno's JSON import reads Postman collections/environments). Import accepts a Postman/Bruno-exported collection or environment back into the app.

### Notes
- Storage is plain JSON files on the VM's local filesystem (atomic writes, same pattern as `devices.yaml`) — no database, no container/volume. Credentials are stored inline in plaintext, consistent with `devices.yaml`; keep port 7071 unexposed.
- Saved requests carry a private `_netconfsw` key for lossless round-trip in this app; Postman/Bruno ignore unknown keys, so files stay fully importable there.

## hitech_automation_ai.1.11.0 — 2026-06-01

Two RESTCONF features.

### Added
- **build-1 — Export request → code.** After a successful https-restconf query, a "🧬 Export request → code" panel offers the equivalent request as **curl**, **python-requests**, and **python http.client**, with Copy. Generated server-side from the fully-resolved request (real URL with vars/device-host rendered, headers, body) and creds inlined, so each snippet runs as-is. curl uses `-sk` (silent + skip-verify) when TLS verify is off (the lab default); params are baked into the URL. Reflects the active request tab; export is not persisted to localStorage (it contains credentials).
- **build-2 — python-restconf sub-mode.** A third RESTCONF mode beside https/curl: write or paste Python and Run it on the VM via `python3` (stdin), with stdout/stderr captured. Mirrors curl-restconf's execution model (host execution, single-user localhost). Pairs with build-1 — generate a snippet, paste it here, run/tweak. `requests` must be pip-installed on the VM; the http.client snippet needs nothing.

## hitech_automation_ai.1.10.1 — 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- XPath "Extract fields → table": the result no longer goes stale. Running a new XPath query now clears the previous extraction (table + row count), and clicking Extract with an empty Row element or no columns clears the old table instead of leaving it on screen. (Reminder: Row element + column paths must match the current XML's schema — the interface defaults are just an example.)

## hitech_automation_ai.1.10.0 — 2026-05-31

Batch of five next-release items.

### Added
- **XPath field extractor (client-side).** Under the XPath result pane, a "Extract fields → table" panel: give a row element (e.g. `interface`) and columns as `label = path` local-name chains (e.g. `in-octets = state/counters/in-octets`), get a copyable table (Copy TSV). Namespace-agnostic, runs entirely in the browser.
- **Agent can read the last result.** New read-only agent tool `read_last_result`: the server caches the latest direct-execute result (NETCONF / RESTCONF / CLI / XPath) and the agent can read it — or extract specific fields from XML by passing `row_element` + `columns` (returns a compact table, avoiding huge-context problems). Ask the agentic bot e.g. "filter the last response for interface name | in-octets | out-octets".
- **`num_ctx` control** in the chat panel (before `max_tokens`): pick the Ollama input context window (default / 4K…128K). Persisted; applies to local chat + agent. Cloud models ignore it.

### Changed
- **XPath result XML is now pretty-printed** (multiline + indented) — server-side `pretty_xml()`, matching NETCONF replies.
- **Config Mgmt content is left-aligned** against the nav (no longer centered), so it sits beside the chat drawer instead of being pushed to the middle.

### Notes
- `num_ctx` sets the *input* window; `max_tokens` still caps *output*. They share the window: keep `num_ctx ≥ input + max_tokens`.

## hitech_automation_ai.1.9.2 — 2026-05-31

**Stylesheet cleanup (no UI change).** Removed orphaned CSS rules left behind by the v1.8.2 Classic UI removal — selectors whose classes/ids no longer exist anywhere in the markup or JS: `#conn-status` (+ .ok/.err), `.grid-2`/`.grid-3` (+ their @media), `.tab-pane`, `.step-block`/`.step-header`/`.step-section` (+ `.step-block pre.output`), `.log-line`, `.alert` (+ .success/.error/.info), `.copy-btn`, `.output-wrapper`, and `.hint`. Verified each was unused before deletion; no live styles touched.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.9.1 — 2026-05-31  (v1.9.0-B)

**Multiple HTTPS RESTCONF requests.** The https-restconf builder now keeps several independent requests, each with its own method, URL, params, headers, vars, auth, payload, and response. A request tab bar sits at the top of the RESTCONF view.

### Added
- Request tabs with **+ Request** (new), **⧉ Duplicate** (clone the current one), close (×) per tab, and rename (double-click a tab).
- Each request's inputs persist across reloads (localStorage). Responses are kept in memory for the session (switching tabs preserves them); they are not written to disk.
- The active request and last edits are saved on tab switch and on page unload.

### Changed
- Dropped the "Postman-style" wording; the structured builder is now labelled "https-restconf (build a request)". Internal sub-tab classes were renamed off the `postman-*` names (no behaviour change).
- The curl-restconf paste mode is unchanged (single request).


## hitech_automation_ai.1.9.0 — 2026-05-31

**Config Mgmt transports are now left-nav items.** NETCONF, RESTCONF, CLI, and XPath moved out of the horizontal tab strip inside Config Mgmt and up into the left sidebar, each as its own nav entry (grouped under a "Config Mgmt" caption, with AI Chat and Docs below). Clicking one shows that transport directly — one fewer click, and the active transport survives reloads.

### Changed
- Left nav: **NETCONF / RESTCONF / CLI / XPath / AI Chat / Docs** (was Config Mgmt / AI Chat / Docs).
- The horizontal Config Mgmt tab strip and its switching logic are gone; the nav drives the panes. Each transport's own sub-controls (Jinja vs XML, RESTCONF params/headers/auth/body, etc.) are unchanged.
- Default view is **NETCONF**. Returning users whose saved view was the old "Config Mgmt" (or "Classic") are routed to NETCONF automatically.

### Removed
- Dead `.cfgmgmt-tabs` / `.cfgmgmt-tab` styles and the tab-click wiring.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.8.2 — 2026-05-31

**Removed the Classic UI.** The original v1.7 layout (the "Classic UI" nav section) is gone, along with everything only it used — lighter app, no dead code. **Config Mgmt is now the default screen.** The shared backend is untouched: `/api/send`, `/api/send-cli`, and `/api/render` stay (Config Mgmt's NETCONF/CLI/Jinja panes run on them).

### Removed
- The Classic panel markup, its nav item, and all Classic-only JavaScript (render/test/send handlers, transport toggle, tab logic, sample-data block, `setStatus`/`showAlert`).
- Backend endpoints `/api/test-connection` and `/api/test-connection-cli` (only the Classic "Test Connection" button called them), plus the now-unused server-side sample-data constants.
- Two AI-Chat hooks that were wired to the Classic editors and would otherwise have been orphaned: the "Insert into Template/Variables" buttons on chat code blocks, and the "Attach context" checkbox (which sent the Classic template/variables to the model). Chat code blocks keep their Copy button.
- The static "● Not connected" badge in the header (it was only ever updated by the Classic Test Connection).

### Changed
- Left nav is now **Config Mgmt / AI Chat / Docs**. Returning users whose saved view was "Classic" are routed to Config Mgmt automatically.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.8.1.4 — 2026-05-31

**Follow-ups to issue-4 + resize.** (1) Added a Copy button to the curl-restconf paste box too. (2) Removed the height *cap* on output panes: they now start at a sensible height, scroll if the content is longer, and drag freely taller (and wider) from the start — like the input textareas. The ⤢ button still toggles a one-click "show everything" in place. No backend changes.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.8.1.3 — 2026-05-31

**Issue-4: Copy buttons on input fields.** A hover Copy button now appears on every input box (previously copy only existed on output/response panes): NETCONF Variables / Jinja2 template / XML payload; RESTCONF URL / Payload / Vars; CLI Variables / Jinja2 template / Raw CLI commands; XPath query. Front-end only — each button copies that field's current value. (The curl-restconf paste box was not in the request, so it has no copy button yet.) No backend changes.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.8.1.2 — 2026-05-31

**UX patch.** Result panes now expand **in place** instead of opening a separate overlay window: the ⤢ button toggles the pane open (grows to fit the full response), and panes are drag-resizable in both directions (corner handle). Removed the pop-up overlay entirely. RESTCONF response body and curl stdout are now **syntax-highlighted when they're XML** (same sky/amber/mint/slate scheme as the NETCONF and XPath panes); JSON stays pretty-printed. No backend changes.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.8.1.1 — 2026-05-31

**UX patch.** Config Mgmt result panes (NETCONF / RESTCONF / CLI / XPath) now wrap long XML/text in place (`white-space: pre-wrap`), so the colorful multi-line output is readable directly in the main pane — no need to open the Expand overlay just to see it. Expand is still there for a full-screen view. No backend changes.


## hitech_automation_ai.1.8.1 — 2026-05-31

**Bug-fix + polish release for the v1.8 Config Mgmt section.** Seven items, front-end-heavy with two new thin backend endpoints. Backward-compatible; the Classic UI and all v1.7/v1.8 endpoints are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Jinja render returned a blank box (and Send then sent nothing).** The Config Mgmt Jinja panes read `data.rendered` from `/api/render`, but the endpoint returns `rendered_xml`. Both the NETCONF and CLI Jinja "Render" and "Send" buttons were affected. Now read the correct field via a shared helper.
- **NETCONF Send and CLI Send returned 404.** The front-end posted to `/api/netconf-send` and `/api/cli-send`, which did not exist — the real routes (`/api/send`, `/api/send-cli`) expect a fully-populated device + secret from the client. Added two thin endpoints, `POST /api/netconf-send` and `POST /api/cli-send`, that take only a `device_name` (plus payload/commands and an operation/mode), resolve the device and its secret from inventory **server-side**, and delegate to the existing send logic. The client no longer handles credentials for these panes.

### Added

- **Operation / mode selectors** on the Config Mgmt send panes: NETCONF Jinja2 → operation (default `edit-config`); NETCONF XML (direct) → operation (default `get`); CLI Jinja2 → mode (default `config_set`); Raw CLI → mode (default `send_command`).
- **YAML / JSON toggle** for the NETCONF Jinja2 variables input. `/api/render` already accepted `format=yaml|json`; the toggle now surfaces it (default YAML).
- **Colorful XML** in the NETCONF and XPath result panes — tags, attributes, attribute values and brackets are syntax-highlighted. Escaping is applied first, so the highlighter is XSS-safe and preserves the literal source representation.
- **Copy 📋 and Expand ⤢ toolbar** on every Config Mgmt result pane (all 11: NETCONF rendered/response, NETCONF XML response, RESTCONF body/headers, curl stdout/stderr, CLI rendered/response, raw-CLI response, XPath result). Copy uses the raw (un-highlighted) text; Expand maximizes the pane into a full-screen overlay (Esc or click-outside to close).
- **Header key/value dropdowns** in the RESTCONF (Postman) Headers table. Common keys (Accept, Content-Type, Cookie, Authorization, X-Auth-Token) and values (`application/yang-data+json`, `application/yang-data+xml`, `application/json`, `APIC-cookie=`, …) are seeded as `<datalist>` suggestions; any new key/value typed is remembered in localStorage and offered next time.

### Changed

- **curl-restconf pane now runs through the host shell.** The pasted text is handed verbatim to `bash -lc` instead of being `shlex.split` + exec'd, and the "must start with curl" guard is removed. Pipes (`| jq`), command substitution `$( )`, variables (`$VAR` / `export`) and `&&` chains now work exactly as they do in a terminal on the VM. Each Run is a fresh shell, so variables persist only **within a single paste** — to chain an ACI login → token → call, paste the whole script at once.
  - This pane executes arbitrary shell on the host as the service user. It is intended for the single-user localhost deployment; **do not expose port 7071 to untrusted networks.** Requires `jq` on the VM for the common `| jq` idiom (`sudo apt install jq`).

## hitech_automation_ai.1.8.0 — 2026-05-30

**Major UX release.** Three big themes: visibility & control over agent runs, top-level UI restructure, and smarter defaults. ~1500 lines of new and changed code across 4 files; backward-compatible with v1.7 — all existing tabs continue to work as before, accessible via the new left nav under "Classic UI".

### Added — Stop & visibility (Group F)

- **Stop button** in the chat composer cancels in-flight agent runs at the next iteration boundary. Implemented via a server-side cancellation registry (`_CANCELLED_RUNS`) checked at the top of each iteration and at each tool-dispatch boundary. Cancels also apply on the resume path (after-approval continuation).
- **Run-id badge** appears next to the Stop button while a run is in progress, showing the active `run_id` for log correlation.
- New endpoint: `POST /api/agent-cancel` accepting `{run_id}`. Returns immediately; the agent loop exits cleanly with `stopped_reason="cancelled"` at the next checkpoint.
- `AgentResult.run_id` is now populated on all return paths (completed, error, max_iterations, awaiting_approval, cancelled).
- `run_agent()` and `_continue_loop()` accept `external_run_id` from the caller, so the UI-generated run_id flows through the whole run lifecycle.

### Added — Left navigation & UI restructure (Group G)

- **Left sidebar** with collapsible navigation. Four top-level destinations: Classic UI, Config Mgmt, AI Chat, Docs. State (active section, collapsed/expanded) persisted in localStorage.
- Width animation between 180px (expanded) and 38px (collapsed). Main content area shifts accordingly via `body { margin-left }`.
- Existing v1.7 layout is wrapped in `#v18-classic-wrap` and surfaced as the default "Classic UI" section — no v1.7 features lost.

### Added — Configuration Management section (Group H)

Direct-execute transports under the new left-nav "Config Mgmt" item. Four tabs:

- **NETCONF** with two sub-modes:
  - *Jinja2 template:* device picker → variables (YAML) → template editor → render → send. Uses `/api/render`; send path corrected in 1.8.1 (see above).
  - *XML payload (direct):* device picker → paste XML → send. For ad-hoc payloads without a template.
- **RESTCONF** with two sub-modes:
  - *https-restconf (Postman-style):* method dropdown, URI, Params/Headers tables, Variables block (Jinja2-templated against URI/headers/payload), Auth (Basic / Bearer / "use inventory device" / None), Payload, Response tab with status line + body + headers details. New endpoint: `POST /api/restconf-execute`.
  - *curl-restconf:* paste a full curl command, execute via subprocess. Multi-line `\` continuation handled. New endpoint: `POST /api/curl-execute`. Defence-in-depth: subprocess uses `shlex.split` (no shell expansion); refuses commands that don't start with `curl`.
- **CLI** with two sub-modes:
  - *Jinja2 template:* same pattern as NETCONF Jinja2.
  - *Raw CLI:* device picker → paste commands one per line → send via Netmiko.
- **XPath:** direct NETCONF XPath query. Device picker, source toggle (operational state `<get>` vs running-config `<get-config>`), XPath input, raw XML result. New endpoint: `POST /api/netconf-xpath`. Reuses v1.7's `_sync_get_state` / `_sync_get_config` with `filter_type=xpath`.

### Added — RAG in agentic mode (Group I)

- When `use_rag=True` is sent with `/api/chat-agent`, the server fetches top-5 corpus chunks for the latest user message and prepends them to the system prompt as "Reference documentation excerpts." The agent's `search_corpus` tool remains available for follow-up queries.
- Frontend automatically forwards the existing "Use RAG" checkbox state when in agentic mode (via a `window.fetch` monkey-patch that intercepts `/api/chat-agent` POSTs).
- Previously, "Use RAG" + agentic just exposed `search_corpus` as a tool — which small models (gpt-oss:20b) often declined to call, leaving the corpus untouched. Now the corpus is always in context.

### Added — RESTCONF 204 hint (Group J)

- `restconf_get` now detects HTTP 204 No Content responses and emits a diagnostic block listing the three common causes: wrong container name (e.g. `ospf` vs `router-ospf` on IOS-XE 17.x), missing standalone module (e.g. `Cisco-IOS-XE-ospf` not installed on some cat8000v images), or genuinely no config. Includes a `curl` snippet for discovering installed modules via `ietf-yang-library:modules-state`.

### Changed

- `APP_VERSION` → `hitech_automation_ai.1.8.0`. Header docstring rewritten.
- `ChatAgentRequest` gains `use_rag: bool` and `run_id: Optional[str]` fields.
- `agent.run_agent()` signature adds `external_run_id: Optional[str]` parameter (default `None` — backward compatible).
- `agent.AgentResult.stopped_reason` adds `"cancelled"` to the enum docstring.
- Agent system prompt unchanged from v1.7.0 (no model-side prompt changes in this release).

### Backward compatibility

- All v1.7 endpoints unchanged. All v1.7 tabs continue to work — accessible via the "Classic UI" left-nav item, which is the default landing area.
- `run_agent()` without `external_run_id` generates one internally (matches v1.7 behavior).
- `/api/chat-agent` requests without `use_rag` field default to `False` (matches v1.7 behavior).

---

## hitech_automation_ai.1.7.0 — 2026-05-30

**Major release.** RESTCONF as third transport, long-lived NETCONF sessions, XPath filters, inventory CRUD from the GUI, and a swag of smaller quality-of-life improvements. ~1700 lines of new and changed code across 9 files; backward-compatible with v1.5/v1.6 inventories.

### Added — RESTCONF transport (Group B)

- New `tools/restconf_tools.py` with seven tools:
  - `restconf_get` — read state/config via HTTP GET, returns JSON. Supports `?depth=N`.
  - `restconf_list_capabilities` — list YANG modules via `ietf-yang-library:modules-state`, with OpenConfig modules highlighted.
  - `propose_restconf_post` / `_put` / `_patch` / `_delete` — approval-gated write tools. Same approval flow as NETCONF: returns `{_approval_pending: True, proposal_id, ...}` and pauses the agent.
  - `apply_restconf_change` — commits an approved proposal.
- Inventory schema gains `port_restconf` (default 443), `restconf_root` (default `/restconf/data`), and `restconf_verify_tls` (default false for lab use). Configurable via flat YAML or pyATS `connections.restconf` / `custom.restconf_*`.
- System prompt updated: agents are instructed to prefer OpenConfig YANG over native Cisco-IOS-XE-* when both exist, and to prefer RESTCONF for simple reads.
- Tool results wrapped with `[RAW_RESTCONF_OUTPUT ...]` / `[END_RAW_RESTCONF_OUTPUT]` markers so the LLM echoes them verbatim on "show me raw" requests.

### Added — NETCONF polish (Group A)

- **XPath filter support** on `get_running_config` and `get_state`. New parameter `filter_type` accepts `subtree` | `xpath` | `none`. Old `subtree_filter_xml` calls still work (auto-detected and treated as subtree). Surgical queries like `xpath_filter="/bgp-state-data/neighbors/neighbor/neighbor-id"` now return only the matching leaves instead of whole subtrees.
- **Auto-retry on `TransportError: Not connected`** — one retry with 2s backoff. Masks the transient flake we hit during v1.6 testing where rapid back-to-back NETCONF calls occasionally returned "Not connected" despite the device being healthy.
- **Better Ollama timeout error message** — when a 600s ReadTimeout fires, the message now lists the four most likely causes (cold load, model too big for hardware, prompt too long, max_tokens too high) instead of a single generic line.
- **Raw NETCONF XML markers** — `get_running_config` and `get_state` results are wrapped with `[RAW_XML_OUTPUT ...]` markers. When the user asks "show me raw" / "xml payload", the LLM (per system prompt) echoes the XML verbatim instead of summarising it.

### Added — Long-lived NETCONF sessions (Group D)

- ncclient sessions are now pooled per-(device, agent-run) instead of per-tool-call. `run_agent` opens a session lazily on first NETCONF tool call and closes it when the run finishes — mirroring how YangSuite works.
- Cuts NETCONF latency dramatically on multi-tool agent runs (TCP handshake + SSH key exchange + NETCONF capability exchange happens once per run, not per call).
- `_continue_loop` (post-approval resumes) gets its own fresh session pool.
- Session pool is cleaned up at every agent exit point: completed, max_iterations, awaiting_approval, provider error.

### Added — Cache busting (Group C)

- Stronger HTTP cache headers on `/`: `no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, private, proxy-revalidate`, `Vary: *`, ETag tied to APP_VERSION, dynamic `Last-Modified`.
- `<meta http-equiv>` cache tags inside the HTML head (belt-and-braces for browsers that ignore HTTP headers in some scenarios).
- `pageshow` event listener forces reload when the page is restored from Chrome's back-forward cache (bfcache).
- Client-side version-mismatch auto-reload: page polls `/api/chat-config` once, compares server version vs `body[data-app-version]`, reloads once per session if they differ. Defeats the "I have to use incognito to see the new UI" problem.

### Added — Inventory CRUD & secrets (Group E)

- **Add / Edit / Delete device buttons** in the Manage Devices sysbar panel. Inline form with all fields (name, host, ports, credentials, device type, read_only, default). Save writes `devices.yaml` atomically via temp+rename, with `.bak` backup. Refuses to overwrite pyATS-format files unless `force_format_switch=true`.
- **External secrets file** at `~/.hitech_automation_ai/secrets.yaml`. New `$secret:VAR` syntax in inventory looks up plain key→value pairs from this file. Precedence: `$secret:` > `$env:` > `%ENV{}`. Recommended `chmod 600`. Cached and invalidated on inventory reload.
- New endpoints: `POST /api/devices`, `DELETE /api/devices/{name}`.

### Added — Sysbar features (Group E)

- **`max_tokens` slider** (256-8192, step 128). Threaded through `/api/chat`, `/api/chat-agent`, `run_agent`, `_continue_loop`, and both providers. "auto" button picks a sensible default based on the current model (qwen-7b→1536, gpt-oss-20b→2048, gpt-oss-120b→4096, claude→4096).
- **Watchdog timeout dropdown** (60s / 120s / 180s / 300s / 600s / Never). Client-side fetch abort timer — independent of Ollama's own 600s timeout.
- **🔥 Warm embed button** — pre-loads `nomic-embed-text` so the first RAG query doesn't pay the cold-load cost.
- **localStorage persistence** for sysbar toggles (auto-warm, pin-models, fallback-claude) plus max_tokens slider value and watchdog selection. Settings persist across page reloads.

### Changed

- `APP_VERSION` → `hitech_automation_ai.1.7.0`.
- Main module docstring rewritten to reflect v1.7 scope.
- `executor.py` dispatches RESTCONF tools alongside NETCONF tools; unknown-tool error message now suggests closest match across all three transports.
- `definitions.py` exposes all 17 tools (5 CLI/general + 5 NETCONF + 7 RESTCONF).

### Backward compatibility

- v1.5 and v1.6 inventory files load unchanged. The new RESTCONF and secrets fields are optional and default to safe values.
- Existing `subtree_filter_xml` calls without `filter_type` are auto-detected as subtree.
- The approval modal is unchanged; new RESTCONF proposals reuse it.

## hitech_automation_ai.1.6.1 — 2026-05-29 (hotfix)

**Fixes** the long-running browser cache issue where upgrading required opening a private window to see the new UI. Chrome's back-forward cache (bfcache) was bypassing the v1.3.3 cache headers.

### Changed

- Stronger HTTP cache-busting headers on `/`: `private`, `proxy-revalidate`, `Vary: *`, ETag tied to app version, dynamic Last-Modified.
- Belt-and-braces `<meta http-equiv>` tags inside the HTML head.
- Client-side `pageshow` listener forces a reload when restored from bfcache.
- One-time version-check on page load: if `body[data-app-version]` doesn't match `/api/chat-config.app_version`, auto-reload (once per session, prevents loops).

Direct upgrade from v1.6.0 — no other changes.

---

## hitech_automation_ai.1.6.0 — 2026-05-29

UX & agent-loop polish. Eight small improvements driven by real-world gpt-oss:20b testing of v1.5.1.

### Added

- **Enter sends, Shift+Enter newline.** Chat input now sends on Enter (like Slack/most chat apps). Use Shift+Enter for newlines. IME composition is respected (CJK input methods aren't affected).
- **`device_name` parameter for `run_show_command`.** The tool now accepts a `device_name` from the inventory. Resolution order: explicit `device_name` → inventory lookup → chat-form fallback. Caught a real bug where gpt-oss:20b would omit the device and silently hit whatever was in the chat form.
- **Per-iteration timing in the trace.** Every agent step shows `(N.Ns)` next to its iteration header, plus a total wall-clock time in the footer. Useful for spotting which iteration is slow on CPU.
- **Closest-match suggestion for unknown tool errors.** When the LLM calls a non-existent tool (gpt-oss:20b sometimes hallucinates `search` instead of `search_corpus`), the error message now says "Did you mean `search_corpus`?" so the model can self-correct.
- **Focus injection at context >10k tokens or iteration >4.** A one-time system message is appended saying "use what you have, stop calling more tools, only use registered tool names." Combats two failure modes seen in production with smaller models: drift (forgetting the original question) and tool-name hallucination (inventing names under context pressure).
- **Raw CLI output preservation.** `run_show_command` now wraps its output in `[RAW_CLI_OUTPUT ... END_RAW_CLI_OUTPUT]` markers. The agent system prompt instructs the LLM to echo this VERBATIM in a fenced code block — preserving the columns, spacing, and exact wording instead of reformatting into markdown tables.
- **Chat input can now shrink.** The textarea was previously locked at a 140px minimum; you could grow it but not shrink it. Now the floor is 40px (about one line). Drag the top-left handle in either direction.

### Changed

- **Agent system prompt rewritten** for clarity. Explicit instruction to pass `device_name` when the user names a device. Explicit list of available tools to discourage hallucination. Explicit "don't repeat the same broken call twice" guidance after seeing 20b do exactly that with malformed NETCONF XML.
- The "📋 From inventory" picker default height is unchanged; only the user-resizable floor moved.

### Why these changes

This release is a direct response to two field-test sessions with gpt-oss:20b on CPU:

1. A `run_show_command` request to cat8Kv72 silently ran on cat8Kv71 because the tool schema had no way to specify a device, and the model couldn't override the chat-form fallback. **Fixed by item 3.**
2. A 6-iteration NETCONF run that successfully self-corrected XML errors in early iterations then hallucinated `search` (non-existent tool) once the context grew past 17k tokens, and never produced a final answer. **Mitigated by items 5, 6, 7.**

The architecture is sound — these are the small rough edges that surface only under real local-LLM load.

### Not in this release (planned v1.7)

- RESTCONF CRUD as a third transport (parked until GPU lands; reasoning model needed for reliable YANG/RESTCONF authoring)
- GUI Add/Edit/Delete device buttons
- External `secrets.yaml` file
- HTML cache-busting via `?v=` query

---

## hitech_automation_ai.1.5.1 — 2026-05-29 (hotfix)

**Fixes** `KeyError: 'port'` raised by `list_devices` agent tool when called against any v1.5.0 inventory. The tool was still reading the old single `port` field from `safe_describe()` output instead of the new `port_netconf` / `port_ssh` pair. Output is now richer too — includes both ports, default flag, and source format.

No other changes vs v1.5.0. Direct upgrade from v1.4.0 is fine.

---

## hitech_automation_ai.1.5.0 — 2026-05-29

Inventory upgrade. Reads pyATS testbed format alongside the v1.4.0 flat format, adds a device picker in the GUI, and surfaces inventory state in the system status bar.

### Added — pyATS testbed format support

`~/.hitech_automation_ai/devices.yaml` now accepts **both** formats. The loader auto-detects which one your file uses by checking whether `devices:` is a list (flat) or a mapping (pyATS).

```yaml
# pyATS — reusable with Genie / Ansible
devices:
  cat8Kv71:
    os: iosxe
    type: router
    platform: cat8kv
    credentials:
      default:
        username: "%ENV{CAT8KV71_USERNAME}"
        password: "%ENV{CAT8KV71_PASSWORD}"
    connections:
      cli:     {protocol: ssh,     ip: "%ENV{CAT8KV71}", port: 22}
      netconf: {protocol: netconf, ip: "%ENV{CAT8KV71}", port: 830}
    custom:
      read_only: false
      default: true
```

Both `%ENV{VAR}` (pyATS standard) and `$env:VAR` (v1.4.0 shorthand) are expanded at load time.

### Added — Two ports per device

Each device now tracks `port_netconf` (default 830) and `port_ssh` (default 22). NETCONF tools (ncclient) use `port_netconf`; CLI tools (netmiko) use `port_ssh`. In pyATS format, both come from the respective `connections.cli` / `connections.netconf` blocks. Old `port:` fields in flat-format files continue to work — they map to `port_netconf`.

### Added — Device picker in the GUI

The Device Info section now has a "📋 From inventory" dropdown. Picking a device auto-fills host, port, username, and the netmiko device_type. The password field is intentionally **not** populated — the form keeps whatever you typed (and the agent's NETCONF tools always read the password directly from the inventory file server-side, never via the API).

When you switch the transport radio between NETCONF and CLI, the port field updates automatically (830 ↔ 22) to match.

### Added — Manage Devices panel in the system status bar

Expand the sysbar to see a `📋 Devices` section with:
- Count of loaded devices and the inventory file path
- Compact table: name, host, NETCONF/SSH ports, device type, read-only flag, password-resolved indicator, source format (flat or pyATS)
- `↻ Reload` button — re-reads `devices.yaml` from disk without restarting the service
- Collapsible "How to add devices" with copy-paste snippets for both formats

### Added — New endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/devices/reload` | Re-read inventory from disk; returns new count |
| `GET /api/devices/connect-info/{name}?transport=netconf\|cli` | Non-password connection info for picker auto-fill |

`GET /api/devices` now also returns a `count` field.

### Added — Inventory state in startup log

```
INFO Inventory: 3 device(s) loaded from /home/sushil/.netconf-sender/devices.yaml (formats: pyats)
```

Visible in `journalctl --user -u hitech_automation_ai`.

### Changed — Inventory upgrade safety

Reiterated: `~/.hitech_automation_ai/devices.yaml`, `audit.log`, and any secrets are all outside the build directory. **Zip-based upgrades never touch them.** Documented in INSTALL.md.

### Migration notes

- v1.4.0 flat-format files keep working unchanged. The old `port:` field is now treated as `port_netconf`.
- If you're using `$env:VAR` from v1.4.0, it still works. New deployments using pyATS testbeds should prefer `%ENV{VAR}` for consistency with other pyATS tooling.
- No breaking schema changes. The Device dataclass exposes `port_netconf` and `port_ssh`; the legacy `.port` attribute remains as an alias for `port_netconf`.

### Not in this release (planned v1.6+)

- GUI Add/Edit/Delete device buttons (writing back to YAML)
- External `secrets.yaml` file with `$secret:VAR` precedence
- Per-model intelligent `max_tokens` defaults
- Configurable watchdog timeout
- Stronger HTML cache-busting via `?v=` query param

---

## hitech_automation_ai.1.4.0 — 2026-05-29

NETCONF write mode with human approval workflow, plus critical LLM fixes carried forward from the v1.3.3 manual patches.

### Added — NETCONF agent tools (six new tools)

The agent can now act on devices via NETCONF (ncclient), not just CLI/show:

| Tool | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `list_devices` | read | Lists devices from `~/.hitech_automation_ai/devices.yaml` |
| `get_running_config` | read | Pulls running-config via NETCONF (optional subtree filter) |
| `get_state` | read | Pulls operational state (interfaces, routes, BGP, OSPF) |
| `validate_config_xml` | read | Validates a payload via candidate datastore without committing |
| `propose_edit_config` | **write** | Proposes a change; returns diff for the approval modal |
| `apply_edit_config` | **write** | Commits a previously approved payload |

Both write tools route through a mandatory human-in-the-loop approval gate. The agent cannot commit without an explicit user click.

### Added — Device inventory file

On first run the app creates `~/.hitech_automation_ai/devices.yaml` with a sample entry. Each device has:

- `read_only: true` (default) — write tools refuse to commit
- `password: $env:VAR_NAME` — keeps secrets out of the YAML file
- `device_type` mapping for ncclient (`cisco-iosxe`, `cisco-nxos`, etc.)

### Added — Approval modal (diff & commit)

When the LLM proposes a write, the UI opens a modal showing:
- Device name + summary line (LLM-supplied plain English)
- Unified diff (current vs proposed XML)
- Full proposed NETCONF `<config>` payload
- **Approve & Commit** / **Reject** buttons

Closing the modal with ✕ or Esc leaves the run paused server-side; you can decide later. Reject feeds a rejection message back to the agent so it explains and stops, rather than retrying the same change.

### Added — Audit log

Every significant agent event is appended as one JSON line to `~/.hitech_automation_ai/audit.log`:

- `tool_call` — every NETCONF tool invocation
- `approval_request` — when the agent proposes a write
- `approval_decision` — user's approve/reject
- `write_applied_ok` / `write_applied_error` — outcome of commits

New endpoint `GET /api/agent/audit?n=50` returns recent entries.

### Added — New endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/devices` | Inventory (passwords stripped) |
| `POST /api/agent/approve` | Resume paused run with `{run_id, approved}` |
| `GET /api/agent/proposals` | List pending/decided proposals |
| `GET /api/agent/proposal/{id}` | Fetch one proposal's diff + XML |
| `GET /api/agent/audit?n=50` | Recent audit events |

### Fixed — Carry-forward LLM fixes from v1.3.3 manual patch ⭐

These were diagnosed during v1.3.3 production use by `journalctl -u ollama` analysis showing `requested context size too large for model` warnings, and applied as a hotfix:

- **Removed forced `num_ctx`** from Ollama payload. v1.3.1 had set a minimum of 8192, which exceeded the native training context of `nomic-embed-text` (2048) and forced extra KV-cache allocation on chat models. Letting Ollama use each model's native default is faster and produces no warnings.
- **Lowered `max_tokens` default 4096 → 2048**. For CPU inference at 5-8 tok/s, 4096 output tokens needs ~500-650s — well over the HTTP timeout. 2048 fits comfortably and is sufficient for most NETCONF/Jinja2 template generations.
- **Bumped HTTP timeout 300s → 600s** in both Ollama and Claude providers. Allows 14b/20b dense models and reasoning models (gpt-oss) to complete on CPU when the user is willing to wait.
- **Cleaned orphan `num_ctx` references** in the Ollama provider's success and ReadTimeout paths (would have raised `NameError` after the fix above).

### Changed

- `tools/definitions.py` returns the union of v1.3 CLI tools + v1.4 NETCONF tools.
- Approval-paused agent runs are stored in-memory keyed by `run_id`. They survive provider errors but not server restarts.

### Not in this release (planned v1.4.1+)

- Per-model intelligent `max_tokens` defaults (CPU-qwen vs GPU-qwen vs Claude)
- UI slider for `max_tokens` override
- Configurable watchdog timeout (currently hard-coded 120s)
- Audit log rotation (use `logrotate` manually for now)
- NSO integration

### Migration notes

- If you applied the v1.3.3 hotfix manually to `llm_providers/ollama_provider.py`, the v1.4.0 source matches your edits — overwriting is safe.
- First run will create `~/.hitech_automation_ai/devices.yaml` with a sample. Edit it before using NETCONF tools.
- For env-var passwords, restart `hitech_automation_ai.service` after exporting the variables so systemd inherits them.

---

## hitech_automation_ai.1.3.3 — 2026-05-28

Biggest visibility/control release. Adds a comprehensive system status bar inside the chat panel.

### Added — System status bar (collapsible)

A new bar between the controls and chat history. Click to expand for full details. Header always shows three live indicators:

- **💾 RAM**: count and total GB of models currently loaded in Ollama
- **📚 RAG**: chunk count or "not built"
- **🧠 Memory**: system memory used/total

Expanded view shows:
- **Loaded models** with individual `⏹ Unload` buttons + bulk **"Unload all chat models"** (keeps nomic-embed-text)
- **RAG database** with path, chunk count, status — and `↻ Rebuild (incremental)` and `🗑️ Full rebuild` buttons
- **Memory dashboard** showing total/used/free + top 10 memory-using processes
- **Performance toggles**: Auto pre-warm on model change, Pin current model (10m keep-alive), Suggest Claude fallback on long requests

### Added — In-UI RAG rebuild

No more SSH-ing in to run `rag_builder.py`. Click `↻ Rebuild` in the system status bar:
- Async background execution — UI stays responsive
- Live output streamed into a console-style box
- Toast notification on completion
- Auto-refresh of chunk count when done

### Added — Cold-load warning icon ⚡

Next to the model dropdown badge, a small ⚡ icon appears when the selected model is NOT currently in Ollama RAM. Hover for tooltip with expected delay.

### Added — Cancel button during requests

A `✕ Cancel` button appears next to Send while a chat request is in flight. Aborts the underlying fetch. Restores normal state. Shows toast "Request cancelled".

### Added — Slow request watchdog with Claude fallback

When using a local Ollama model, if a request runs >120s the UI prompts:

> ⚠️ {model} is taking longer than 120s.
> Would you like to CANCEL this request and retry with claude-sonnet-4-6 instead?

Click yes → request aborts, model dropdown switches to claude-sonnet-4-6, ready to resend. Toggleable in the sysbar.

### Added — Auto pre-warm on model change

Sysbar checkbox. When ticked, changing the model dropdown to a non-loaded local model triggers an async `/api/ollama-warm` call. By the time you finish typing the prompt, the model is in RAM.

### Added — Pin current model toggle

Sysbar checkbox. When ticked, warmed models use `keep_alive=10m` instead of the default `5m`. Useful for "I'm testing this model intensively for the next 30 minutes."

### Added — Cache-busting headers

The root HTML now serves with `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0` and `Pragma: no-cache`. **Prevents the stale-HTML-in-incognito issue** you experienced upgrading from 1.3.1 → 1.3.2.

### Added — Six new backend endpoints

- `GET /api/ollama-loaded` — current loaded models from Ollama's `/api/ps`
- `POST /api/ollama-unload` — unload one or all (with `keep` list to protect embeddings)
- `POST /api/ollama-warm` — pre-load a model with custom keep-alive
- `POST /api/rag-rebuild` — async kick off `rag_builder.py`
- `GET /api/rag-rebuild-status` — poll rebuild progress + tail output
- `GET /api/process-memory` — `ps`-based top 10 memory hogs + `free -h` totals (Linux only)

### Fixed — Attach checkbox layout

`📎 Attach context` (renamed from the longer label) is now grouped with the other action checkboxes (Use RAG, Agentic, Compare) rather than pushed to the far right via `margin-left: auto`. The `🗑️ Clear` button now occupies the far-right position. **The Attach checkbox can no longer fall off-screen** at any reasonable chat panel width.

### Migration notes

- **No new pip dependencies**
- **No new env vars required**
- All v1.3.2 features (vector_db outside build, top-left resize handle, auto-migration) intact
- The hard-refresh-after-upgrade habit is no longer required — cache-busting handles it automatically
